2. Search bar needs to work (searching individual token's contents or owner address)
3. Trending = Order in Tokens with the most likes -> least likes
4. Latest = Order in Tokens which are freshly minted -> old
5. Load More buttons = Needs to load 5 more tokens on each click
6. Categories section (top menu) should work to sort tokens within that category. By clicking, it only shows contents in that category

8. When users click on the owner address on a token, it needs to redirect to a page which only shows tokens owned by that owner address
9. Each token has an opensea.io link (the logo) and it needs to redirect to the link according to its token ID (e.g. Token ID 1 = https://opensea.io/assets/0x5f8d73f746307900209fd128830a3c2da34cbbdb/1)
